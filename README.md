# Withdrawal Button for Magento 2

> Magento 2 extension for implementing the EU right of withdrawal via button click.

---

## What is it about?

The EU Directive **(EU) 2023/2673** requires that in the future, consumers must be able to withdraw from online purchase contracts just as easily as they were concluded. **Starting June 19, 2026**, a clearly visible withdrawal button will be mandatory in online shops.

This Magento module provides exactly that: your customers can withdraw orders with just a few clicks – directly from their customer account or via a separate form for guest orders. As a shop operator, you maintain a full overview in the admin area.

---

## What does the module do?

### For your customers

**Withdrawal button in the order overview**

In the *My Account > My Orders* view, a new column appears for each order. There, the customer can see at a glance:

- A **Withdrawal link**, as long as the period is active
- The note **"Withdrawal submitted"**, if a withdrawal has already been made
- The note **"Withdrawal period expired"**, if the withdrawal period has passed

Additionally, a **"Withdrawal Order"** button is displayed on the order details page.

**Withdrawal detail page**

Before the actual withdrawal, the customer sees a summary of their order:

- Order number, date, status, total amount
- All ordered items with name, SKU, quantity, and price
- The deadline until which withdrawal is possible, calculated from the date of the last shipment
- A button for final submission – with a preceding security confirmation

**Partial withdrawal (optional)**

If the shop operator has activated the partial withdrawal option, the customer can select individual items from the order instead of withdrawing the entire order. Each item has a checkbox (pre-checked) and a quantity input field. Items that have already been withdrawn in a previous request are shown greyed out and cannot be selected again. This means several partial withdrawal requests can be submitted for the same order until all items are covered.

**Guest orders**

Customers who ordered without an account can access the withdrawal via a dedicated search form. Entering the order number and email address is sufficient to find the order and initiate the withdrawal.

Accessible at: `/withdrawal/guest/search`

**Confirmation page**

After submission, the customer is redirected to a success page. This confirms that the withdrawal has been received and that an email is on its way.

### For you as a shop operator

**Admin overview of all withdrawals**

Under *Sales > Withdrawals*, you will find a tabular overview of all received withdrawals:

- ID, order number, customer name, email
- Status (Pending / Confirmed / Rejected)
- Type (Full / Partial)
- Date of order and date of withdrawal
- Direct link to the respective order view

All columns can be filtered and sorted.

**Withdrawal detail page**

Each row in the grid has a *View Details* action that opens a dedicated detail page. It shows:

- All metadata: customer name and email, order number, withdrawal type, status, order date and withdrawal date
- Quick action buttons to confirm or reject the request directly on the page
- A complete table of the withdrawn items including product name, SKU and quantity – clearly labelled as full or partial withdrawal

This makes it possible to review exactly which items a customer has withdrawn without leaving the admin area.

**Automatic email notification**

Soon as a withdrawal is received, two emails are sent:

1. **To the customer** ₓ Confirmation with order details
2. **To you** – Notification with all relevant data

The email templates can be customized in the admin panel.

**Note in the order**

Every withdrawal is automatically added as a comment in the order history. This way, it is immediately apparent in the order view that a withdrawal exists.

**Configurable**

In the admin under *Stores > Configuration > Sales > Withdrawal Settings*:

- Enable/Disable the module
- Set recipient address for notifications
- Set withdrawal period in days, counted from the last shipment date (Default: 14)
- Enable/Disable partial withdrawal (Default: No)
- Select email sender and templates

## Hyvä Theme Compatibility

If you are using the Hyvä Theme, please install the Hyvä compatibility module:

https://github.com/Zwernemann/magento2-withdrawl-hyva

This module adds the required Hyvä frontend integration for the withdrawal button and ensures compatibility with the Hyvä template system.

The base module remains required.

### REST API

Withdrawal entries can also be retrieved programmatically:

```
GET /rest/V1/zwernemann/withdrawals`
```

Access is protected by ACL permission (`Zwernemann_Withdrawal::withdrawals`).

### Multilingualism

Completely translated into all 24 languages of the EU (97 strings). Further languages can be added via custom CSV files.

## System Requirements

|Component | Version|
|---|---|
| Magento 2 Open Source | 2.4.6 to 2.4.8-p4 |
| PHP | 7.4 or higher |

## Installation

### Via ZIP file

1. Extract the ZIP file and copy the entire contents to:

   ```
   app/code/Zwernemann/Withdrawal/
   ```

 2. Ensure the structure looks like this:

   ```
   app/code/Zwernemann/Withdrawal/
       Api/
       Block/
       Controller/
       Helper/
       Model/
       Ui/
       etc/
       i18n/
       view/
       composer.json
       registration.php
   ```

3. Run the following commands in the Magento root:

   ```
   php bin/magento setup:upgrade
   php bin/magento setup:di:compile
   php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy de_DE en_US
   php bin/magento cache:flush
   ```

4. Check if the module is active:

   ```
   php bin/magento module:status zwernemann_Withdrawal
   ```
### Via Composer

```
composer require zwernemann/module-withdrawal
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy de_DE en_US
php bin/magento cache:flush
```

---

## Setup

1. Log into Magento Admin
2. Navigate to **Stores > Configuration > Sales > Withdrawal Settings**
3. Set **Enable Module** to *Yes*
4. Enter **Notification Email** – withdrawal notifications will be sent here
5. Adjust **Withdrawal Period** if the legal period differs
6. Set **Allow Partial Withdrawal** to *Yes* if customers should be able to withdraw individual items
7. Configure email sender and templates if necessary
8. Save and flush cache

### Linking the Guest Order Form

The search form for guest orders is located at:

```
https://www.your-shop.com/withdrawal/guest/search
```

Include this link, for example:

- In the footer of your shop
- In order confirmation emails
- On your withdrawal policy page

With Magento URL rewrites, you can adjust the address as desired, for example to `/withdrawal`.

---

## Uninstallation

```bash
php bin/magento module:disable Zwernemann_Withdrawal
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
php bin/magento cache:flush
```

Then delete the directory `app/code/Zwernemann/Withdrawal/`.

The database tables `zwernemann_withdrawal` and `zwernemann_withdrawal_items` remain and can be removed manually if needed.

## Version History

### 1.8.0
- Admin: order history now records a comment when a withdrawal request is confirmed or rejected
- Admin: withdrawal detail page now links to the related shipment(s) and their packing slip PDF
- Security: the withdrawal success page is now bound to the customer session and no longer exposes an enumerable order ID in the URL; added robots noindex,nofollow
- Fix: corrected a timezone difference between the admin grid and the withdrawal detail page
- Completed and corrected translations across all 24 languages (withdrawal type label in customer email and the success page title are now translated)
- Clarified wording: customer order overview now shows "Withdrawal period expired"; clearer message when re-selecting already-withdrawn items
  
### 1.7.3
- Full PHP7.4 compatibility
  
### 1.7.2

- Fix multiple Magento 2 issues: refactor select-all into AMD component, remove inline styles in favor of CSS, rename reserved “select” class, persist guest email via session instead of URL, and correct withdrawal validation flow.

### 1.7.1

- Fix database table name resolution for shops with a table prefix
  
### 1.6.0

- Partial withdrawal (Teilwiderruf): customers can now select individual items and quantities when submitting a withdrawal request
- New backend setting *Allow Partial Withdrawal* (default: No) – full-order withdrawal remains the default behaviour
- Already withdrawn items are shown greyed out; further partial requests can be submitted for the remaining items
- New database table `zwernemann_withdrawal_items` stores the item-level withdrawal data
- Admin grid shows a *Type* column (Full / Partial) for each withdrawal entry
- New admin detail page (*View Details*) shows all withdrawal metadata, quick confirm/reject actions, and a full table of withdrawn items with name, SKU, and quantity

### 1.5.0
- Newly added languages: Bulgarian, Danish, Estonian, Finnish, French, Greek, Irish, Italian, Croatian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Swedish, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Czech, Hungarian.

All translations use the legally correct term for the statutory right of withdrawal in accordance with the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU).

### 1.4.0
- Deleted the version attribute from composer.json. Composer has great integration with version control systems like Git, Mercurial and Subversion and there is no need to manually track version numbers in a text file for Composer at all.
